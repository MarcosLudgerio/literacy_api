# literacy-api

```
An API that provides datas for literacy purposes.
```

The literacy API provides a multimedia database to feed applications whose main purpose is the literacy. This database is structured by words that are associated to contexts. Doing this we believe that the process of learning will be more efficient,   taking into account that the contexts will be pertinent to the routine of each individual.
